# 🚗 Trusted Auto Data

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **Trusted Auto Data (TAD)** — an open-source platform transforming how vehicle telemetry and service history are collected, verified, and shared.

---

## 🌐 Our Mission

We aim to create a decentralized, secure, and transparent system for managing vehicle data, empowering:

- **Drivers** to own and monetize their car data
- **Fleets** to track and verify usage and maintenance
- **Dealers, insurers & leasing companies** to access tamper-proof vehicle histories
- **Developers** to build apps around verified automotive telemetry
